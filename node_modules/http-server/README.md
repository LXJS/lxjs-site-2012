# http-server: a command-line http server

`http-server` is a simple, zero-configuration command-line http server.  It is powerful enough for production usage, but it's simple and hackable enough to be used for testing, local development, and learning.

## Installation:

Installation is via `npm`.  If you don't have `npm` yet:

     curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh
     
Once you have `npm`:

     npm install http-server -g
     
This will install `http-server` globally so that it may be run from the command line.

## Usage:

     http-server [path] [options]

The entire /mypath tree will now be available at `http://localhost:8080/`.

`-i` Display autoIndex (defaults to 'True')

`-s` or `--silent` In silent mode, log messages aren't logged to the console.
